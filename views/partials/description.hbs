<p>Pair Programming

<br>

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, focuses on the bigger picture, and immediately spots mistakes.
<br>
Together, the programmers help each other hold strong attention on the task.
<br>
It is a simple but very effective tool.
<br>
<br>
Environment
<br>
The options we've found for pairing, in order of effectiveness, are:
<br>
<br>
    Pair in person
    Video call while working collaboratively on a remote computer such as Cloud9.
    Video call with screen sharing (Skype, Google Hangouts, appear.in, etc.) If you can't meet up in person, and you don't have adequate internet connection for options 2 or 3, you won't have adequate communication lines to pair program
<br>
Instead, you can get some of the benefits with:
<br>
    Phone call and slack to discuss approaches, ideas and issues.
    Share pseudocode and code on slack.
<br>
<br>
When pairing:
<br>
    First, check-in with your pair
    Assign roles (driver and navigator)
    Explain your thinking in a clear concise manner
    Keep a timer, to monitor how long you have been in a certain role
