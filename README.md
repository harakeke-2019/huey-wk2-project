STEPS:


MVP:
1. As a user, I want to recieve a lovely little welcome to make me feel...well..welcome
2. As a user, I want to see all the options available to style my boring notes
3. As a user, I want to have a preview of what the styles look like. 
4. As a user, I want to see the results of my styling with a single click.
5. As a user, I want a home button to take me back to the options just in case I don't like the style I applied.

Stretch: 
6. As a user, I want the option to enter my own custom text into text fields to be styled. 

Super-stretch:
7. As a user, I want to see a little (or big) image in my styled notes to REALLY make me feel like I'm in that era. 


TESTS:
- four options showing 
- id's match
- post routes in between inputs and outputs
